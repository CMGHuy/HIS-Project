The project wants to simulate the model of a Conveyor Belt system with one main line and two induction lines. In order to have a practical system, a set of requirements is predefined. 

Papyrus-RT is used to construct the model. After that, in order to verify whether the model matches its specification, it is translated into nuXmv model checker. All the informal properties are being formalized using Linear temporal logic. The properties verfication result specifies which features are satisfied. Otherwise, counter log traces are available to give a counter example of that specification.

The model of the entire system is in the CBelt.smv file.
